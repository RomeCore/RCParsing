# RCParsing Tutorials Overview

Welcome to the tutorials for **RCParsing**, a powerful lexerless parsing library designed for creating efficient and flexible parsers in C#. These tutorials provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and using the library's core features, from building basic rules and tokens to handling advanced parsing scenarios like indentation-based syntax.

## Getting Started

This section covers the fundamental concepts and components of `RCParsing`. Whether you're new to parsing or an experienced developer, these tutorials will help you leverage the library's capabilities to build robust parsers tailored to your needs.

## Table of Contents

- [Main Concepts](main-concepts)
  - Learn about **Tokens**, **Rules**, and **Barrier Tokens**, the core building blocks of the `RCParsing` library.
- [Rule and Token Building](rule-and-token-building)
  - Understand how to create and combine rules and tokens using `ParserBuilder` to define your grammar.
- [Auto-skipping](auto-skipping)
  - Explore how to configure skip-rules and manage whitespace requirements in your grammar.
- [Deduplication](deduplication)
  - Discover how `RCParsing` optimizes your parser by deduplicating rules and tokens.
- [Transformation and Intermediate Values](transformation-and-intermediate-values)
  - Learn how to transform parsed data into structured output using intermediate values and transformation functions.
- [Settings and Their Override Modes](settings-and-their-override-modes)
  - Dive into configuring parser and rule behavior with settings and inheritance modes.
- [Barrier Tokens](barrier-tokens)
  - Master parsing complex, context-sensitive syntax like Python-style indentation using barrier tokens.
- [Initialization Flags, Debugging, and Performance](initialization-flags-debugging-and-performance)
  - Optimize your parser with initialization flags and debug effectively with detailed error reporting.
- [Elements Library](../elements_library/)
  - Explore the full range of rule types and token patterns available in `RCParsing`.

## Next Steps

Start with the [Main Concepts](main-concepts) to grasp the foundational elements of `RCParsing`. Then, explore specific topics based on your parsing needs, such as handling whitespace with [Auto-skipping](auto-skipping) or building complex grammars with [Rule and Token Building](rule-and-token-building).

Happy parsing!
